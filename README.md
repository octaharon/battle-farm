## Trivia

`Battle Farm` is a turn based card game for 2-6 Players. Every Player has a number of garden beds which they can improve
and plant different crops to. If a crop yield harvest, a Player gains coins. When the game ends, the Player with the
highest amount of coins wins. The `battle` part of it comes from different actions that, that Players can invoke upon
each other with limited Cards to gain advantage.
